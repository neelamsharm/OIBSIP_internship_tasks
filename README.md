The Python Voice Assistant project is a simple implementation of a voice-controlled assistant named "Nova." It recognizes spoken commands from users and performs tasks such as opening a web browser, searching Wikipedia, telling the time, and opening Notepad. Users interact with Nova by speaking commands through the microphone, and Nova responds with spoken feedback. The project demonstrates the integration of speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis capabilities in Python and serves as a starting point for exploring voice assistant technology.
